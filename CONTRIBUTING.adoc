= Contribution Guide

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç Contributions
are welcome from anyone on the internet, and even the smallest of fixes
are appreciated!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Keep and its
packages. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best
judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull
request.

== Getting started

1. Fork https://github.com/keep-network/coverage-pools[`keep-network/coverage-pools`]
2. Clone your fork
3. Follow the <<./README.adoc#build-and-test, Build and test>> section
   in the repository's README.
4. Setup the recommended <<Development Tooling>>.
5. Open a PR against the `main` branch and describe the change you
   are intending to undertake in the PR description.

Before marking the PR as ready for review, make sure:

* It passes all tests (`yarn test`).
* It passes the linter checks (`yarn lint`) (see <<Pre-commit>> to make this
  automatic).
* It passes the Slither analysis (`slither .`) (see <<Slither analyzer>>).
* It passes all continuous integration jobs.
* Your changes have sufficient test coverage (e.g regression tests have
  been added for bug fixes, unit tests for new features)

== Development Tooling

Commits
https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-commit-signature-verification[must
be signed].

=== Continuous Integration

This project uses https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub Actions] for
continuous integration. All GitHub Actions jobs must be green to merge a PR.

=== Pre-commit

Pre-commit is a tool to install hooks that check code before commits are
made. It can be helpful to install this, to automatically run linter
checks and avoid pushing code that will not be accepted. Follow the
https://pre-commit.com/[installation instructions here], and then run
`pre-commit install` to install the hooks.

=== Linting

Linters and formatters for Solidity and JavaScript code are set up and
run automatically as part of pre-commit hooks. These are checked again in CI
builds to ensure they have been run and are passing.

If you want to change a rule, or add a custom rule, to the JavaScript or
Solidity linting, please propose these changes to our
https://github.com/keep-network/solhint-config-keep[solhint-config-keep] and
https://github.com/keep-network/eslint-config-keep[eslint-config-keep]
packages. All other packages have it as a dependency.

=== Slither analyzer

https://github.com/crytic/slither[Slither] is a static analyzer used to detect
contract vulnerabilities at development stage. A Slither analysis is run
as part of the CI workflow and is required to merge a PR. It may be helpful
to run it on the development machine, before pushing local changes to the remote
branch. To install Slither, please follow the
https://github.com/crytic/slither#how-to-install[Slither installation guide].
You will need https://www.python.org/[Python] and
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity[solc] as prerequisites. We strongly
recommend to use the same versions as defined in the env variables of the
`contracts-slither` CI job config defined in the
https://github.com/keep-network/coverage-pools/blob/main/.github/workflows/contracts.yml[`.github/workflows/contracts.yml`]
file:

- `python-version` for Python version
- `SOLC_VERSION` for solc version
- `SLITHER_VERSION` for Slither version

Keep in mind that solc version should be the same as the version used internally
by Hardhat (`solidity.version` property defined in
https://github.com/keep-network/coverage-pools/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts[`hardhat.config.ts`]).
This way Slither will use the same version as used during the contract
compilation process and avoid errors while performing the analysis.

Once Slither is installed, you can run the analysis by simply doing:
```
slither .
```
A report with analysis outcomes will be presented. You'll need to decide
whether to solve or ignore reported problems. If you decide to ignore,
please double-check your decision to avoid ignoring a real vulnerability.
